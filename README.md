## üîß Configuration

### Voice Settings
The assistant automatically detects and configures the best available voice on your system. You can modify voice settings in the `_configure_voice()` method.

### API Configuration
- **Gemini AI**: Already configured with the provided API key
- **Weather API**: Set `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` environment variable
- **News API**: Set `NEWS_API_KEY` environment variable

### Listening Modes
- **Normal Mode**: 15-second timeout, 30-second phrase limit
- **Continuous Mode**: 30-second timeout, 60-second phrase limit

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Core Technologies
- **Speech Recognition**: Google Speech Recognition API
- **Text-to-Speech**: pyttsx3 (cross-platform TTS)
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API
- **Audio Processing**: PyAudio for microphone input

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Separate handlers for different command types
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all operations
- **Memory Management**: Intelligent conversation memory with topic categorization
- **Background Processing**: Timers and long-running tasks run in background threads

### Performance Features
- **Dynamic Energy Threshold**: Automatically adjusts to ambient noise
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable listening timeouts
- **Memory Optimization**: Limited conversation memory to prevent memory bloat

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Microphone not working**:
   - Check microphone permissions
   - Ensure PyAudio is properly installed
   - Try different microphone input devices

2. **Speech recognition issues**:
   - Speak clearly and at normal volume
   - Reduce background noise
   - Check internet connection (required for Google Speech Recognition)

3. **Gemini AI not responding**:
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check if the API key is valid
   - Ensure the API endpoint is accessible

4. **Installation problems**:
   - Use Python 3.7+ 
   - Install Visual C++ build tools on Windows (for PyAudio)
   - Try `pip install --upgrade pip` before installing requirements

### Performance Tips
- Use continuous listening mode for longer questions
- Speak clearly and at a consistent pace
- Keep the microphone at a consistent distance
- Minimize background noise

## üîí Privacy and Security

- **Local Processing**: Speech recognition and TTS run locally
- **API Communication**: Only sends text queries to Gemini AI
- **No Recording**: No audio is stored or transmitted
- **Memory**: Conversation history is stored locally and can be cleared
